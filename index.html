    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>This is the era of information technology, with computer science at its foundation.Thus, 
        if society wants to reap the full benefits of information technology and experience rapid economic advancement, 
        studying computer science is essential. 
        The study and creation of applications that enable our daily use of computers, 
        the software systems that underpin these applications, and the techniques and procedures employed to create reliably accurate,
         morally upright, and consistent systems and applications are all included in computer science. 
        Employers who hire Computer Scientists expect competent programmers with knowledge of modern techniques and tools and 
        the ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development, construction, and maintenance of their systems. 
        The core competency of Computer Science is computer programming</p>
